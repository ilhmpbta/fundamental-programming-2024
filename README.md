Implementation of the book "Problem Solving and Program Design in C" as my very first book into the world of compsci  

This repository contains my implementations of exercises from the book **"Problem Solving and Program Design in C"**.  
It serves as my first structured dive into the world of computer science, covering fundamental programming concepts in C.  

## **Topics Covered**
- Basic syntax and control structures  
- Functions and modular programming  
- Arrays and pointers  
- File handling  
- Problem-solving techniques  

This repo is a work in progress as I improve my coding skills. Feel free to check out my progress! ðŸš€
