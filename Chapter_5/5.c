/*
The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers is the product of the integers' common factors. Write a program that inputs two numbers and implements the following approach to finding their gcd. We will use the numbers âˆ’252 and 735. Working with the numbers' absolute values, we find the remainder of one divided by the other.

    0
735 252
    0
    252

Now we calculate the remainder of the old divisor divided by the remainder found.

    2
252 735
    504
    231

We repeat this process until the remainder is zero.

    1
231 252
    231
    21

    11
21  231
    211
    21
    21
    0
The last divisor (21) is the gcd.*/

int main(){
    int number1, number2, remainder;
    scanf("%d %d", &number1, &number2);
    number1 = abs(number1);   // problem requires using absolute values: "Working with the numbers' absolute values, we find the remainder of one divided by the other"
    number2 = abs(number2);

    while(number2 != 0){
        remainder = number1 % number2;
        // number2 becomes the new divisor, and the remainder becomes number2
        
        number1 = number2;
        number2 = remainder;
        // loop continues until number2 becomes 0, ensuring number1 doesn't become 0 to avoid infinite loop
    }

    printf("The last divisor (%d) is the GCD", number1);

    return 0;
